      <description>In the beginning, there was nothing. There was no time, and no space. This is called 无极 (wújí).
In naming wújí, nothing becomes something. Infinite possibilities burst through. Thus arose from wújí, 太极 (tàijí).
Tàijí is a state of being of the cosmos that arose from the nothingness called wújí. It is a store of infinite possibilities. Of things that have yet to come and of events that have yet to happen.</description>
